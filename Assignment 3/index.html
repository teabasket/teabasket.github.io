    <h3 aria-labelledby="Blog 1 title"> The Chains of Time </h3>
    <h5 aria-labelledby="date"> February 20, 2018 </h5>
    <p id="blog1"> When one thinks about the concept of time it is a way for us to understand the world in a systematic sense.
      what does it mean? How can we be faster? Do we have enough Time? These are common questions that we tend to ask
      and it stands to be very reasonable. I am from Colorado a relative chill place, in terms of weather and people, and
      one thing is clear about the culture. No one here is in a hurry. Its a very grand and beautiful place where the mountains
      and you become best friends relatively quickly, and every sunrise and sunset is like it was captured by film makers. I took
      a trip to New York this summer and I was amazed at how no one seemed to look up.
      Time was literally chained to their ankle because every minute of every day was a time to show productivity. It truly scared
      me. </p>
    <p id="blog1">I often think about time travel, as an impossible paradoxical concept that humans created to idealize the ability to change
      the unchangeable. But think about it, what if it were possible. Neil Degrasse Tyson once said that 4th dimensional creatures
      would most likely be able to traverse through their own timeline like walking through a park. They could visit their birth,
      or graduation, and it would be like how we travel the third dimension everytime we jump. As humans, what an ideal that would be
      because are we not just stuck in our present, only being able to regret the past, and worry about the future? Well I argue that
      the best way to conquer an enemy is to befriend it. So for argument's sake lets say that time is our enemy. Its our enemy because
      we are constantly trying to beat it, by being faster, doing more things, not living in the present. And it is doing a fantastic job
      in this battle because, boy are we losing. So why not befriend our fellow time. Instead of treating it like the competition that we
      have to beat, we treat it with the respect it deserves. Think of the chains of time that are tied to your ankle like a friend of
      encouragement. It's telling you that you only have a limited amount, look up and around take a deep breath in, and observe the world
      around you. The beauty, the mess, the relationships, the hope, everything that you are missing. Turn the chains into bungee cables,
      where you can travel and jump, and trust that everything will happen when it needs to. Please leave your thoughts below!</p>
